Chinese Support Redux
=====================

A rewrite and port of the Chinese Support add-on to Anki 2.1 (Python 3).

Status
------

For now, the vast majority of features have been successfully ported, and the add-on is in a usable state. That said, Microsoft Translator and Google TTS have been temporarily disabled; they will be restored to the menu as soon as I have them working.

As this is a beta release, there may be occasional errors. Please report these [here](https://github.com/luoliyan/chinese-support-redux/issues) on GitHub and I will attend to them. Feature requests are also welcome.

If you are new to the Chinese Support add-on, the wiki from the previous version is still relevant ([here](https://github.com/ttempe/chinese-support-addon/wiki)).
